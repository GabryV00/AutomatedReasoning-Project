# AutomatedReasoning-Project
Modeling the most efficient path problem in MiniZinc and in Logic Programming

## Goal of the project

The goal of the project is to implement two models, one in MiniZinc and one in Logic Programming, to efficiently solve the problem of finding the most efficient path.

## Architecture

The project consists of the following parts:
* The *models* folder contains the model in MiniZinc and the one in Logic Programming
* The *data* folder contains 30 input instances, of varying difficulty
* The *generator.py* file generates test data instances for the models, based on the input parameters
* The pdf file is a well detailed report (written in Italian) in which the problem is introduced, the implementation in MiniZinc and the one in Answer Set Programming are explained; finally the results of the tests carried out are reported
